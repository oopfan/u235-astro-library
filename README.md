# u235-astro-library

> This repository contains two projects. The main project is an Angular web app that shows off the features of the second project: an Angular library of components, directives, and classes that are useful for creating Astronomy applications.

Please refer to the README of the **```u235-astro```** project for many more details.

**```u235-astro```** is now an NPM package. Please visit [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and search for it. Please do not mistake it for 'u235-astrolib'. That was my first NPM package having very limited functionality.

If you wish you can clone this repo and run the web app locally:

1. Clone the repo.
1. At the terminal run **```npm install```**
1. Then **```ng build u235-astro```**
1. Finally **```npm start```**
1. Launch your browser and go to localhost:4200
